2️⃣ Dynamic Pipeline for Microservices

Right now pipeline builds everything.

Make it smarter:

✔ Detect changed service
✔ Build only that service
✔ Tag & deploy only that container

👉 This is how large microservice platforms work.

🔹 3️⃣ Advanced Quality Gates (Enterprise Practice)

You already have Sonar.

Take it further:

✅ Fail build if:

code coverage < threshold

critical vulnerabilities found

duplicated code > threshold

👉 This enforces engineering discipline.
🔹 4️⃣ DevSecOps Enhancement 🔐

Take security scanning deeper:

✔ Add SAST scan (Semgrep / CodeQL)
✔ Secrets detection (GitLeaks / TruffleHog)
✔ Dependency vulnerability scanning
✔ SBOM generation (Syft)

👉 Security-first pipelines are HOT in hiring.
5️⃣ Artifact Management (Real Enterprise Pattern)

Instead of only DockerHub:

✔ Store artifacts in Nexus / Artifactory
✔ Versioned builds
✔ Traceability between build → artifact → deployment

👉 This shows release engineering maturity
